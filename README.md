# Albert-s_DB

Taking Freddy's DB calls and Santiago's Test and structuring them the way Ryan wanted them in /database

The only think I did was separated Freddy's DB calls from the mongoose schemas
The mongoose schemas are in the models folder all of freddy's db api calls are in the database folder
If you want to get a closer look to what type of calls you will be making look into the test folder that was created by Santiago and in the testUsers.js file I just changed some of the variable names to fit my db
